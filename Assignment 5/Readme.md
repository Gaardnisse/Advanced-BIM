# Project Reflection
## Learning experience for the concept
At the beginning of the course, it was only possible to make a BIM model in a closed software, and no in depth knowledge of IFC and OpenBim software was known. 
There has been a development in the knowledge which can be seen in the figure below:

The progression can e.g. be seen in the ability to extract the data for the tool from an Ifc model, which was not possible at the start of the course. The understanding of property- and quantity sets were further expanded when having to add data to the model and construct property sets ourselves and alter existing data. 
The importance of data exchange between other professions or data sources and the data formats was also further understood from the creation of the BPMN diagram and description of the necessary inputs and outputs of the model. This was also wanted to be done in an accessible way, by not defining it in python. A material library outside of python was not obtained, but the intentions were there. Between Assignment 2 and Assignemnt 3 the tool was also developed a lot, but fx. calculating areas and volumes of spaces with not already pre-defined vaues in ifc, which had previously been a hindrance for the tool to calculate on all the spaces. This is also made possible by the improved coding skills during the course, and some things could potentially have been simplified with the later gained knowledge. 

It is still necessary to further master other elements of OpenBim and the advanced bim environment. The main understanding from the course is based on the Ifc strucutre and IfcOpenShell, but the ability to use other tools and understand ontology further is still in the future learning scope.

## Proces of developing the tool

The process of developing the tool was in no way linearly and was paved with having to overcome obsatcles both rooted in coding/implementation in python, understanding the abilities of IfcOpenShell, and utilizing the structure of Ifc. The tool was produced from trial-and-error basis, but trying to do basic milestones, and then progressing from there. The needed self-learning of the mentioned problems however also gave a good understanding of OpenBim and Ifc structure out of necessity in order to create the tool. 
The construction of the tool also pushed us to relate to how to convey the end results of the tool to the end user by making plots, lists, output files and print statements in order to undertand the mechanics and performance of the tool and the results.

For the use case it was very nice to be able to independently decide what to dive into since the tool can be more passion driven and expanded more based on curiosity. Had the possibilites been more limited the willingness to expand and work with the tool is thought to be minimized compared to working with something self-selected. More initial feedback on the choice of use case and scoping of the use case would have been nice, in order to be assured that the case was valid, usefull, and with enough depht.   


% - Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
% - Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
% - Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?




##Feedback of the tutorial

The tool was found to adreess the use case as well as being usefull for the relevant OpenBim role. The use case was generally thought to be very well and extensively modeled. The tutorial format was however too long, losing the attention of learner. The explanation of the used-based input to the console could have been showcased further, since it was not fully understood how it functioned. The walk-through of the script and intro was however found very useful, and the script was understood by the reviewing parties. Further improvements or expansion of the tutorial could include a written instruction of the script, but since the .py file was out-commented, it was found usefull in and of itself. 


% - did the tool address the use case you identified?
% - was the use case well modelled
% - was the project clearly scoped



## Future for advanced use of OpenBim

It is very likely to be used in further in our prefessional lives, since the potential is unlimited and possible to use in order to ease workstreams. By understanding the underlying structure of IFC and the broader understanding of OpenBim and information storage and structure makes it possible to retrieve the needed data and possibly implement it in simpler tools. It's expected that for bigger coorporations to have more designated programmers that design the tools, but by understanding the power and limitations of a tool and data, it makes it possible to give inputs, alter or any thing else. It's also expected that we would get in touch with OpenBim when exchanging data with other parties. 


% - are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
% - are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
